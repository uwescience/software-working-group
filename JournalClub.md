# Software Journal Club (SJC)

## Background
Building and using software is an essential part of modern scientific research.
With new software technologies being created at an ever rapid pace, it is
challenging for researchers to learn about new capabilities that can enhance their
research productivity and effectiveness.
The Software Journal Club provides a community and resources for learning about
software technologies, best practices, and applications.
Our vision is that software should be treated as a kind of literature that should
be shared, read, reviewed, and critiqued.
The intent is to serve both mature software developers as well as software beginners.

## What We Do
SJC is primarily a discussion forum. Topics include the following.

- Technology reviews. This will be a discussion of the
content and application of new software technologies such as a python scientific
package or a software design pattern.

- Code review. 
Code reviews are a discussion of
the problem being
addressed by the software, the technical approaches used
in the solution, and the manner in which the code is engineered.
This may be a project that you have created, or it could be
a project that you want to learn about.
Much like a literature review, the intent is that the discussion will
involve comparisons with other projects.

- Problem brainstorming. This is an open ended discussion of a software problem. It may well
be a discussion far in advance of any code being written.
This can be quite valuable for those with limited experience with software who aren't sure
how to approach a problem.

## How We Do It
SJC meets approximately once a month.
Requests to be on the agenda should be submitted to the Chair of the eScience Software Working
Group who controls the agenda for the SJC.
