# Software Journal Club (SJC)

## Background
Building and using software is an essential part of modern scientific research.
With new software technologies being created at an ever rapid pace, it is
challenging for researchers to learn about new capabilities that can enhance their
research productivity and effectiveness.
The Software Journal Club provides a community and resources for learning about
software technologies, best practices, and applications.
Our vision is that software should be treated as a kind of literature that should
be shared, read, reviewed, and critiqued.
The intent is to serve both advanced software developers as well as software beginners.

## What We Do
SJC is primarily a discussion forum. Topics include the following.

- Technology reviews. This will be a discussion of the
content and application of software technologies such as a python scientific
package or a [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

- Code review. 
Code reviews are a discussion of
the problem being
addressed by the software, the technical approaches used
in the solution, and the manner in which the code is engineered.
This may be a project that you have created, or it could be
a project that you want to learn about.
Much like a literature review, the intent is that the discussion will
involve comparisons with other projects.

- Problem brainstorming. This is an open ended discussion of a software problem. It may well
be a discussion far in advance of any code being written.
The discussion might, for example, focus on 
[software requirements specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification).
Such discussions
can be extremenly valuable for those with limited experience with software who aren't sure
how to approach a problem.

## How We Do It
SJC meets approximately once a month.
Requests to be on the agenda should be submitted to the Chair of the eScience Software Working
Group who controls the agenda for the SJC.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- "I already know a lot about software.  Will I learn anything?"

..* Possibly. There's a lot to learn. But you may still find value in
connecting with a community with whom you can discuss software problems.
And, of course, you may be able to answer questions that others have.

- "I have no idea what a code review is.  Why is this important?"

..* A code review is a discussion of the software problem you are trying to solve
and how you are solving it.
For example, it may be that they problem you want to solve is already handled
by existing open source software, which might save you a lot of time.
Another possibility, which occurred in one of our meetings, is that the
scientist thought that they had an impossibly big difficult problem,
and someone pointed out a very simple approach that was implementable within a couple of hours.

- "I only want tech reviews; will you announce the meeting topics ahead of time?"

..* An agenda will be posted in advanced so that you can focus on your areas of interest.

- "I'd like to present my software; can I do that?"

- "How big of a group will this be?"

..* The size will vary depending on interest in the topic being discussed, likely between
ten and twenty attendees.
