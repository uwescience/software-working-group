# Software Journal Club (SJC)

## Background
Building and using software is an essential part modern scientific research.
With new software technologies being created at an ever rapid pace, it can be
challenging for researchers to learn about new capabilities that can enhance their
productivity.
The Software Journal Club provides a community and resources for learning about
software technologies, best practices, and applications.
Our vision is that software should be treated as a kind of literature that should
be shared, read, reviewed, and critiqued.
The intent is to serve both mature software developers as well as software beginners.

## What We Do
SJC will meet approximately once a month.
We envision several kinds of meetings.

- Technology reviews. This will be a discussion of the
content and application of new software technologies such as a python scientific
package or a design patern.

- Code review. Code reviews are an opportunity to get feedback from colleagues about
the design and packaging of a project. 
Reviewers will have a chance to share the
innovations.
Often, reviewers will discover more efficient
ways to solve software problems. 

- Problem brainstorming. This is an open ended discussion of a software problem. It may well
be a discussion far in advance of any code being written.
This can be quite valuable for those with limited experience with software who aren't sure
how to approach a problem.

## How We Do It
Requests to be on the agenda should be submitted to the Chair of the eScience Software Working
Group who will have the final say about scheduling.
